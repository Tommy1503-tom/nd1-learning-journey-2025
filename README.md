# IoT Ecosystem & Development

Welcome to my Internet of Things (IoT) repository. This project serves as a comprehensive guide and portfolio covering the core pillars of IoT development, from hardware integration to network communication.

## 1. IoT Concepts

Understanding the architectural layers of IoT:

* **Perception Layer:** Sensors and actuators interacting with the physical world.
* **Network Layer:** Secure data transmission and connectivity.
* **Application Layer:** Data processing, UI/UX, and smart services.
* **Edge vs. Cloud:** Strategic placement of compute power.

## 2. Embedded Systems

The "brain" of the operation. This section focuses on hardware selection and low-level control.

* **Microcontrollers:** Experience with ESP32, Arduino, and STM32.
* **SBCs:** Single Board Computers like Raspberry Pi for gateway applications.
* **I/O Protocols:** Interfacing with peripherals via **I2C, SPI, and UART**.
* **Power Management:** Deep sleep modes and battery optimization for remote nodes.

## 3. Communication & Networking

How devices talk to each other and the internet.

* **Wireless Protocols:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), LoRaWAN, and Zigbee.
* **Messaging Protocols:** Lightweight communication using **MQTT** and **CoAP**.
* **Data Serialization:** Efficient data packaging using JSON or Protobuf.

## 4. Software & Programming

The logic driving the hardware and data flow.

* **Firmware:** Developed in C/C++ (Arduino/PlatformIO) and MicroPython.
* **Backend:** Node.js or Python-based servers for data ingestion.
* **Dashboards:** Real-time visualization using Grafana, Node-RED, or custom React apps.
* **Security:** Implementation of TLS/SSL for secure MQTT and OTA (Over-the-Air) updates.

## 5. Future Works / Projects
